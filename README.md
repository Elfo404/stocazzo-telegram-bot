Hi! I am a Telegram bot using Stocazzo As A Service (https://github.com/scaas/stocazzo)

You can talk to me on [Telegram](https://telegram.me/StoCazzo_io_bot) and ask me anything, I'll do my best to answer to questions like:

- [...] chi?
- [...] big chi?
- [...] Chi?
- [...] big Chi?
- [...] CHI?
- [...] big CHI?
- [...] ascii chi?
- [...] big ascii chi?
- [...] _chi?
- [...] big _chi?

I can also probably answer a lot more questions, in that case consider submitting an issue as my creator didn't intended it (and he doesn't know how to regex).

##License

srsly?
